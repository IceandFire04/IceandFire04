## Hi!
I'm IceandFire04, and I like playing video games among other real-life things. I like programming, art, swimming, and music composing.

My favorite games are Plants vs. Zombies, Terraria (Calamity also), Doom and every now and then Geometry Dash. 
I mostly learn how to code from modding, mainly from the games mentioned.

### Languages I'm Learning
- C# by modding Terraria and some Unity
- C++ from modding Plants vs. Zombies
- ZScript with GZDoom mods

That's about it! Stuff isn't posted here often, but I'll post it here when I can!
