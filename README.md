## Hi!
I'm IceandFire04. I like programming _(really!)_ and other things like art and stuff.

My favorite games are Plants vs. Zombies, Terraria (+Calamity), Battle Cats and Sea of Thieves. 
I mostly learn how to code from modding, mainly from some of the games mentioned.

### Languages I'm (Kinda) Learning
- C# by modding Terraria and Unity stuff
- C++ from modding Plants vs. Zombies
- Python from Battle Cats (TBCML)

That's about it! Check out my other repos if you're interested!!

_John 3:16 - For God so loved the world he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not die but have eternal life._
