## Hi!
I'm IceandFire04. I like programming and I'm working on other things like art and stuff. I also swim.

My favorite games are Plants vs. Zombies, Terraria (Calamity also), Doom, Sea of Thieves and osu. 
I mostly learn how to code from modding, mainly from some of the games mentioned.

### Languages I'm (Kinda) Learning
- C# by modding Terraria and Unity stuff
- C++ from modding Plants vs. Zombies

That's about it! Check out my other repos if you're interested!!
