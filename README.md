## Hi!
I'm IceandFire04 (MrNooberDude is an old name), and I like playing video games among other non-virtual things. I also have a interest in the periodic table and chemistry, as well as art and, of course, programming.
My favorite games are **Plants vs. Zombies, Terraria (Calamity too) and Geometry Dash** _(If you couldn't tell from my stars)_. 
I mostly learn how to code from modding, mainly from the games above.

### Languages I'm Learning
- C# by modding Terraria
- C++ from modding Plants vs. Zombies and random games made in class

That's about it! Stuff isn't posted here often, but I'll post it here when I can!
